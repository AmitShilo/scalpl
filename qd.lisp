;;; Lossy trades

;;; The most common lossy trade execution happens when a limit order rolls
;;; through one or more offers but isn't filled, and thus remains on the
;;; books. If this order is large enough, it'll get outbid by the next round of
;;; the offer placement algorithm, and the outbidding offer will be lossy
;;; relative to the trades previously executed.

;;; How bad is this?

;;; In some situations, the remaining limit order gets traded back rapidly:
